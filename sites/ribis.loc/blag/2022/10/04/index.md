I'm stretched thin right now, all my guys are in jail. they're sitting tight, and they're solid, and I got my other guys watching them to make sure they're solid. I'm vetting a new bunch of guys right now. so far I introduced em to a fake me who's giving them the runaround; making them dig holes in the desert, dismantling microwaves, restoring a trampled flowerbed, etc. soon as they figure out he isn't me I'll get them to start sitting in cars watching eachother, for weeks. At the end of each day I gather em in a circle and fire a gun into the air and we all scatter before the cops show. I'll schedule a high security armed raid, and anyone who brings a weapon is out. The guys who brought tuna sandwiches and a big flashlight? They're solid. End of the night I'll call the cops myself, see how they react, see if the cops are solid.
